This repository holds codes for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Deliveries and Pickups based on the "Vehicle Routing Problem with Deliveries and Pickups: Modelling Issues and Meta-heuristics Solution Approaches" research paper from Niaz A. Wassan1 and GÃ¡bor Nagy. 

The two different .ipynb files refer the two different Christofides and Eilon 1969 datasets (the xml files). 

The solution for each case also includes a plot.
